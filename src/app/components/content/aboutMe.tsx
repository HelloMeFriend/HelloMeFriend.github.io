            Hello! I&apos;m Omar ALSHANYOUR, a passionate software developer with a knack for creating. I&apos;m a recent alumnus of Concordia University with a bachelors degree in Software Engineering.
            Lately, I&apos;ve been really passionate about cloud computing and web development. I also like to spend a bit of time delving into the world of game dev. As for AI, I think I&apos;ll leave
            it to the experts and focus on learning how to use it effectively and ethically in my projects. <br /><br />

            Outside of coding, I greatly enjoy immersing myself in different sorts of media and arts, as I feel it&apos;s important to nurture one&apos;s understanding of the world. I also enjoy hiking, football (soccer), and going to the gym. My current favourite song is <i>Harvest Moon</i> by Neil Young. Current favourite movie is
            <i> How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies</i> from Pat Boonnitipat. Current favourite book is <i>Native Son</i> by Richard Wright. <br /><br />

            Feel free to reach out if you&apos;d like to connect or collaborate on something exciting!
